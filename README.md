# About Me

Hello, I just use this account for side projects (whether they be complete or incomplete ðŸ˜…).

Feel free to peruse or just take a glance at everything!

### Currently...

I was working on a Spotify clone, but their playback SDK doesn't seem to want to play with my environment I am developing it in, so onward with different projects.

Now I am working on a new project I'm calling CafÃ©. I'm writing the server code in Rust and am planning on making a couple of basic apps for mobile and desktop just to learn more full stack development skills.
